Game State Creation
-------------------

With our current implementation sharing code from the Unity Boss Room sample, we are using GameStates to process the logic of different scenes (Both in games and outwith).

Each scene requires a State, however states can persist between states. Additionally, there should currently only ever be a maximum of 1 state on the Server and 1 on the Client, and both should be on the same GameObject.



Creating a GameState implementation
-----------------------------------

Have the GameState inherit from the abstract class "GameStateBehaviour" and ensure that you override the 'ActiveState' property.
	Server and Client GameStates should share the same ActiveState value.
Override the value of 'Persists' to have the GameState persist across multiple scenes until another GameState overrides it.

Use a "NetcodeHooks" component to gain access to OnNetworkSpawn and OnNetworkDespawn events if required.

Ensure that the in-scene implementation of the GameState has the ApplicationController assigned as its DI Parent ('Parent' field in the inspector)
